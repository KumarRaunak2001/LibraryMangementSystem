# LibraryManagementSystem
It is the project I developed for the owner of Winner digital Library in Ayodhya to digitalize the management system of students and books which was earlier been done manually.  

The ‘Library Management system’ undertaken as a project is based on relevant technologies, which is an attempt to automate the existing library. The project enables its user to perform all the operations regarding a library. The project enables the user to make entry of a new book, deleting the record of a book from the library, issuing a book to member, making entry of a new member, deleting the record of a member from the library etc.  The process model we have used for our project is Linear Sequential because the requirements are well stated and understood before in hand. In analysis phase we analysed the requirements of what the project will do. We collected the requirements needed to develop the project. Then in the design phase we designed our project according to user satisfaction. We created database to store the details of members, books in tables. We designed DFD diagrams based  upon the operations that was carrying in the project. Then cost and effort estimations are calculated and testing and coding processes have been carried out.
Hence in the existing system for LIBRARY MANAGEMENT SYSTEM, the performance evaluation system and the maintenance are done manually. The proposed system will maintain 


The few of the working images of the project and database is described below:
